# NLP
Natural Language Process

With reference to an in-depth practical experience training on **Project Jupyter** and **JupyterLab**, with the assistance of hands-on course on **Natural Language Processing Specialization** at coursera.org, I am trying to achieve and share the following -

1. Implementing sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words by using the logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors

2. Implement auto-correct, autocomplete & identify part-of-speech tags for words by using the dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings 

3.  Analyzing sentiment, text generation & named entity recognition by using the recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs & Siamese network in TensorFlow & Trax

4.  Machine translate complete sentences, summarize text, build chatbots & question-answering by using the encoder-decoder, causal, & self-attention

_Please, do point out the silly mistakes, and help me in improving, as it is a work in progress_

Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages
